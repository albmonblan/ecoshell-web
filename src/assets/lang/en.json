    "faq_hero_desc": "Technical breakdown of the prototype and Shell Eco-Marathon 2026 rules updates.",
    
    "cat_chassis": "Chassis & Aerodynamics",
    "q_material": "What material is the monocoque made of?",
    "a_material": "The chassis is a high-modulus <strong>carbon fiber</strong> monocoque with a <em>honeycomb</em> core to maximize torsional rigidity with minimum weight. The firewall separating the engine compartment from the cockpit is made of fiberglass for fire safety.",
    "q_weight": "What is the total weight of the vehicle?",
    "a_weight": "The prototype has a curb weight of between <strong>25 and 27 kg</strong>. This includes all mechanical systems (engine, transmission, steering) and electronics, excluding the driver.",
    "q_position": "What is the driving position and ergonomics?",
    "a_position": "The driver lies in a <strong>supine position</strong> (lying on their back), supported by the firewall, with legs extended under the steering. This posture drastically reduces the frontal area and center of gravity. Rear brake on the right hand, front brake on the left foot.",

    "cat_engine": "Powertrain & Performance",
    "q_engine_spec": "What are the power unit specifications?",
    "a_engine_spec": "We use a <strong>Honda GX35</strong> base (originally for light machinery), modified to 4-stroke and Otto cycle. We have reduced its displacement from 35cc to <strong>32cc</strong> to optimize specific consumption in our operating range.",
    "q_fuel": "What fuel does it use?",
    "a_fuel": "We currently compete in the <strong>Ethanol</strong> category (ICE Prototype). Simultaneously, we are developing the conversion of the same engine block to run on <strong>Hydrogen</strong> for future seasons.",
    "q_performance": "What is the operating speed?",
    "a_performance": "The competition rewards efficiency, not top speed. Our 'Burn & Coast' race strategy maintains an average speed of <strong>25 km/h</strong>, reaching peaks of 50 km/h during acceleration phases.",

    "cat_electronics": "Electronics & Telemetry",
    "q_ecu": "How is electronic control managed?",
    "a_ecu": "The system is centralized in a custom-programmed <strong>ECU (Electronic Control Unit)</strong>. It manages injection and ignition based on real-time sensor data. We use solid-state relays for efficient energy management.",
    "q_pcb": "How is the wiring designed?",
    "a_pcb": "We have migrated from a traditional wiring scheme to custom <strong>PCBs (Printed Circuit Boards)</strong>. This allows for a more compact, reliable, and lightweight system, integrating everything from the horn and lights to engine management.",

    "cat_steering": "Vehicle Dynamics",
    "q_steering_mat": "What technology is used in steering and wheels?",
    "a_steering_mat": "The wheels are an in-house design made entirely of carbon fiber. The steering rod is also carbon, with high-strength steel inserts and rod ends to ensure geometric precision.",
    "q_steering_angle": "Is a large steering angle necessary?",
    "a_steering_angle": "No. Competing on speed circuits with wide curve radii, the steering system is optimized for stability on straights and fast corners, requiring reduced steering angles.",
    "q_wheel_buttons": "What functions does the steering wheel have?",
    "a_wheel_buttons": "The steering wheel integrates three critical controls: the 'dead man' system (emergency cut-off if released), the engine start button, and the mandatory horn actuation.",

    "rule_3": "<strong>Hydrogen ICE:</strong> Hydrogen internal combustion engine demonstrations are allowed at all events, subject to technical inspection.",
    "rule_4": "<strong>Own Data:</strong> The organizer-supplied on-board computer is eliminated. Teams must develop their own telemetry systems.",
